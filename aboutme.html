                <p>My  first  education  is  Marketing.  In  2011, I graduated from the Kyiv National University of Trade and Economics and received an honours degree in Marketing (Master). After graduation for 4 years, I worked in marketing. It was an interesting job, but with time I realized that design was of great interest.</p>
