            <div class="textbody">As a first step I thought what kind of website I want to make. I defined for myself which information I want to put in it and according to that I thought about website structure. Then I made a rough sketch.</div>
            <div class="photo"><img src="website/1.jpg"></div>
            <div class="number">2</div> 
            <div class="textbody">Next step was preparing design. As I planned to use only vector graphic I made my design prototype in Illustrator.</div>
            <div class="photo"><img src="website/2.jpg"></div>
            <div class="number">3</div> 
            <div class="textbody">Then I started preparing my code. At the beginning I did not thought about visual appearance and did not try to make it look as on my design project. At first I prepared code and divided it into separate blocks so it would be easy to work with it. I started with the main page of website. For every element I made a separate div and gave it class name, so I could style it directly in css.

            <div class="photo"><img src="website/3.jpg"></div>
            <div class="number">4</div> 
            <div class="textbody">For the block of topics I made separate container, which contained separate div for each block and inside it two separate divs for title: topic and week number. The last div was meant for footer.
