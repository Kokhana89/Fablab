            <div class="heading">With Light and Melody</div>
                        
            <div class="number">1</div> 
            <div class="textbody">As usual first step is preparing your design. I decided to make a Christmas card with using both options: light and sound. I used Illustrator to prepare my layout. And then I separated all element and grouped by color to cut them out on Silhouette.
            </div>
            <div class="photo"><img src="postcard/1.jpg"></div>
            
            <div class="number">2</div> 
            <div class="textbody">To cut all elements on Silhouette I had to try different settings, because my cardboard was quite thick. You can settings on the photo.
            </div>
            <div class="photo"><img src="postcard/3.jpg"></div>
            <div class="photo"><img src="postcard/2.jpg"></div>
            
            <div class="number">3</div> 
            <div class="textbody">Next step is preparing your electric circuit. In my design I planned to use: two LEDs and speaker, which should play music and blink. For that I needed to program ATtiny. So I needed: two LEDs, speaker, ATtiny and resistor. For resistor you have to calculate resistance.
            <p></p>
            I tried different ways to put all things together, but I did not want to cross copper tape that is why I turned Attiny into horizontal position.
            </div>
            <div class="photo"><img src="postcard/4.jpg"></div>
            
            <div class="number">4</div> 
            <div class="textbody">Next step is putting everything on the postcard. You also have to solder all connections. While soldering ATtiny you have to be very careful and keep legs of it separated and do not touching each other, other wise you might cause short circuit.</div>
            <div class="photo"><img src="postcard/5.jpg"></div>
            
            <div class="number">5</div> 
            <div class="textbody">Quite challenging was making the switch. My idea was to make a switch in Santa's hat. In position down it would interrupt connection between batteries and copper tape and in position up it would make postcard work. Because batteries are quite heavy I could not just tape them, so I made the small box. Also I glued them together because when I was moving the hat batteries were moving as well and there was no connection. I used silicone glue gun. </div>
            <div class="photo"><img src="postcard/6.jpg"></div>
            <div class="photo"><img src="postcard/7.jpg"></div>
            
            <div class="number">6</div> 
            <div class="textbody">Next step is combining everything together with design parts. Because in the first design I did not think where I am going to attach speaker, I decided to make chimney to cover speaker. So I printed it on Silhouette. I made a whole in it for the sixe of speaker, if I covered it with cardboard sound would be very hard to hear. I glued chimney on double side tape, but with Santa I could not do that becuse of batteries. So I desided to made small border which will hide all inside and hold Santa. </div>

            <div class="photo"><img src="postcard/9.jpg"></div>
    
            <div class="number">8</div> 
            <div class="textbody">Final result</div>
