            <div class="textbody">In last decade people buy much less printed books. Most of the time it is a hard task to impress readers and attract their attention with the book cover. In a book stores there are hundrets of books and it is very likely that most of them will not be noticed. That is why I thought about creating a book cover which can attract attention of a customer in a different way.

            <div class="textbody">That is why I thought about creating a book cover which can attract attention of a customer in a different way. My idea is to create a book cover with integrated motion sensor, which can react with light (and maybe sound) on passing by people. Also in a home usage this book can be easily used a night light just by standing on tha shelf.
